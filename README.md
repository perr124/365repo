# User Notes
Thanks again for this opportunity. Direct link to the project can be accessed at https://widgets-475f6.web.app/

I used Typescript for this project to improve error-handling and intellisense. I also know that's what is used at CMG and thought it'll be reasonable to implement. I am capable of switching the project to plain JS if necessary, please just let me know.


# What I would have done/improved if I had more time
- The CI/CD process. I deployed to firebase and setup a github repo. I setup a very basic CI/CD flow to build and deploy all push requests to the my Firebase setup.
